            <p>How long does your kid take to answer 8 + 7? Does he still use his finguers? How about 99 + 99?</p>

            <p>

                Automatic recall of basic math facts (math fluency) is generally considered a key foundation for higher
                level math skills.
            </p>

            <p>
                My kids can add and subtract multiple digits. But we still do single digits addition math drills. Why? Because the goal is not to teach him Math. He already understands the concept. The goal is to make him fluent in Math.
                I want Math to be like a second language for them. To achieve that, they need to be able to automatically recall basic math facts, without using fingers or spending much time on them. They also need to understand there are often different ways to solve the same Math problem, and to learn shortcuts.
            </p>

            <h6>Shortcuts</h6>

            <p>
                How do your kids solve 99 + 99? Do they have to write it down on paper, then add the single column, then figure out the carry, then add the tens column?
                I want my kids to solve it by figuring out that 99 = 100 - 1, so 99 + 99 = 199 + 100 - 2.
                The more Math facts they're able to automatically recall, the more shortcuts they'll be able to find by themselves.

            </p>
            <h6>Timed</h6>

            <p>

                These worksheets should be timed. It's important to let your kids know that they'll need both speed and accuracy. They often ask me, which one is more important. I tell them they're equally important.
                It's just as bad to take an hour to solve one worksheet perfectly as it is to solve the worksheet in 2 minutes, but get half of it wrong.

            <h6>Worksheets</h6>

            <p>
                I organized worksheets by operation types and level. As they get comfortable with a level, I create a new level and have them practice it.

        <p>I would love to hear suggestions for new worksheets and what you think of this site.</p>
